# Online-voting-system
Online Voting System with registration, login, and role-based dashboard using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project is a **frontend prototype** where users can register as **Voter** or **Party**, log in, and see a personalized dashboard. All user data is stored locally in the browser using `localStorage`.

## Features

- User registration with validation (password confirmation, unique mobile number)  
- Login authentication  
- Role-based dashboard:
  - **Voter** → Can vote (prototype message)  
  - **Party** → Can view results (prototype message)  
- Logout functionality  
- Responsive design with modern UI


## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
3. Register a new user or login with existing credentials.  
4. Navigate through the dashboard and test the role-based content.  

> Note: This is a frontend prototype. All data is stored in the browser's localStorage, so clearing the browser will remove all user data.
